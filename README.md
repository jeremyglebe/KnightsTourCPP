# KnightsTourCPP
The Knight's Tour puzzle implemented as a C++ Console Application. (Styled as a game, not a solver)

This program was created when I was teaching Data Structures & Algorithms and was used as an in-class review. I was going to have them make a similar project on their own but time didn't allow for that. Anyway it is pretty cool.
