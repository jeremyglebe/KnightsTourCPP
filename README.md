# KnightsTourCPP
The Knight's Tour puzzle implemented as a C++ Console Application. (Styled as a game, not a solver)

This program was created when I was teaching Data Structures & Algorithms and was used as an in-class review. I was going to have them make a similar project on their own but time didn't allow for that. Anyway it is pretty cool.

## Running KnightsTourCPP
KnightsTourCPP is a C++ program. You can compile it yourself or run it online using [Replit](https://replit.com/@jeremyglebe/KnightsTourCPP). I have embedded the replit project below.

_In the README on GitHub this will just appear to be an HTML tag. You must be on my website to actually run it._
